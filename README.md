# Project: Linked Lists

This is a solution to the [Project: Linked List](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists). The [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) provides a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online. Since its inception, it has helped many students get hired as developers and has assisted countless others in learning enough programming to work on their own personal projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Create Two Classes/Factories:

- `LinkedList class / factory`, which will represent the full list.
  = `Node class / factory` containing a value function and a link to the nextNode, set both as null by default.

Build the following methods to the LinkedList class:

- `append(value)` adds a new node containing value to the end of the list
- `prepend(value)` adds a new node containing value to the start of the list
- `size` returns the total number of nodes in the list
- `head` returns the first node in the list
- `tail` returns the last node in the list
- `at(index)` returns the node at the given index
- `pop` removes the last element from the list
- `contains(value)` returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
- `find(value)` returns the index of the node containing value, or null if not found.
- `toString` represents your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format should be: ( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> null

### What I learned

I have learned what linked lists are and how they work. Linked lists are similar to arrays as they both contain data, but differ in notable ways. Linked lists are dynamic as compared to arrays, which are static. It is faster to insert, remove data using Linked lists. Random search is where arrays are superior. I have also become more comfortable using recursion as I mostly used it in this project.
